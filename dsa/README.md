# What kind of data structure and algorithm are you going to use?
## Data Structure
### Basic data structure
- Array(list)
- Hash Map(dict)
- Hash Set(set)

### Abstract data structure
- Stack (list)
- Simple/Circular/Priority/Double-Ended Queue (deque, heap)
- Singly/Doubly/Circular Linked List (list)
- Graph
- Tree
  - N-ary Tree
  - Binary Tree
  - Binary Search Tree
  - Height-balanced Binary (Search) Tree
  - AVL Tree  
  - Trie

## Algorithm
Basic categories of algorithms: Insert, Update, Delete, Sort, and Search

### Sort
- bogo sort
- bubble sort
- insertion sort
- shell sort
- selection sort
- merge sort
- quick sort
- heap sort
- counting sort
- radix sort
- bucket sort
- topological sort
- kahn's topological sort


### Search
- Linear search
- Binary search

1. [Basic DFS & BFS](DFS_BFS.md)
2. [Shortest Path]()

- Depth first search/ Backtracking
- Breath first search
- Bidirectional search
- A*(A star)

### Greedy algorithm
Looks for locally optimum solutions in the hopes of finding a global optimum
- Ford-Fulkerson algorithm
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- Kruskal's algorithm
- Prim's algorithm

### Dynamic programming
Problems that have overlapping subproblems AND optimal substructure property (If not, use a recursive algorithm using a divide and conquer approach)
- Floyd-Warshall algorithm
- Longest Common Sequence
