# Sequence Models

## Sequence Problems

1. Sequence classification (many-to-one, many-to-many)
  - DNA sequence analysis
  - **Sentiment analysis**
  - Vido activity recognition
  - **Name entity recognition**
2. Sequence prediction (many-to-one, many-to-many)
  - Weather forecasting
  - Stock market prediction
  - Product recommendation
3. Sequence generation (one-to-many)
  - **Text generation**
  - Music generation
  - Image caption generation
4. Sequence to sequence prediction (many-to-many)
  - **Text summarization**
  - **Machine translation**
  - Speech recognition
  - **Question answering**
  - **Language inference**


## Sequence Model Architectures
- Recurrent Neural Network(RNN)
  - Simple RNN
  - Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU)
  - Long Short Term Memory(LSTM)
  - bidirectional LSTM 
- Transformer
