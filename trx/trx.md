# Eunsoo's TRX Guide

Hello, I'm a passionate and dedicated TRX practitioner with experience in rehabilitation and strength training. Iâ€™ve been training with TRX since the beginning of 2024, and in just over a year, it has transformed me physically, mentally, and emotionally. From my own experience, I can confidently say that TRX is one of the safest and most effective exercises. I'm eager to lead TRX in group fitness classes, helping others discover the transformative power of TRX in an inclusive and supportive environment.
