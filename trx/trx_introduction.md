# TRX Coaching Guide

## Benefits of TRX
1. **Full-Body Workout**: TRX engages multiple muscle groups at once, helping improve strength, balance, flexibility, and core stability in a single session.
2. **Core Activation**: Almost every TRX move requires core engagement due to the instability of the straps, which strengthens deep abdominal muscles and improves posture.
3. **Scalability for All Levels**: Exercises can be modified easily by adjusting your body angle or strap length, making TRX suitable for beginners to advanced athletes.
4. **Low Impact**: It’s gentle on the joints, making it a great option for those recovering from injury or looking for effective, low-impact training.
5. **Improves Mobility and Flexibility**: Many TRX exercises involve dynamic stretches and movements that increase range of motion and help prevent injuries.
6. **Portable and Space-Efficient**: TRX gear is lightweight and easy to set up almost anywhere—home, gym, outdoors—making it ideal for travel or small spaces.
7. **Enhances Functional Strength**: TRX mimics real-life movements, which helps improve coordination and strength you actually use in daily life and sports.
8. **Boosts Cardiovascular Fitness**: With the right programming (like HIIT or circuit style), TRX can also provide a solid cardio workout in addition to strength training.

## Anatomy of TRX
- Suspension anchor
- Main carabiner
- Equalizer loop
- Locking loop
- Mid length mark
- Adjustment tabs
- **Adjusters**
- **Handles**
- **Foot cradles**
- Adjusting Length
- To lengthen: Hold onto the adjusters, pull them both back 
- To shorten: Pull down on the adjuster and with the other hand hold onto the adjustment tabs and pull upwards to your desired length: Short < Mid length < Mid calf < Fully lengthened

## Coaching System

### Setting the Standards: Foundational Movements + What should be **STABLE** vs. **MOBILE** 
- **Plank**: Full body
- **Pull**: Full body in proper alignment vs. shoulder girdles, shoulders, elbows
- **Hinge** (Hip-dominant): Torso vs. maximal hip flexion-extension with minimal knee flexion-extension
- **Push**: Core and lower body vs. shoulder girdles, shoulders, elbows
- **Rotate**: Torso moving in a cylinder fashion vs. Ankles, hips, t-spine, arms
- **Squat** (Knee-dominant): Spine vs. Ankles, hips, and knees (maximal hip flexion-extension with maximal knee flexion and optimal ankle dorsiflexion)
- **Lunge**: Torso vs. Ankles, knees, and hips

### Principles of Progression/ Regression
- **Vector Principle**: The closer to the anchor point, the more difficult, the farther from the anchor point, the easier the exercise is.
- **Pendulum Principle**: The closer to the anchor point your feet are, the easier. The farther from the anchor point, the more difficult the exercise is.
- **Stability Principle**: The further apart your feet are, the easier the exercise. The closer your feet are, the more difficult the exercise is. (Feet apart < Feet narrow < Single leg)

### Cueing Convention: **NAPS-MR**
- Name: Name of the exercise
- Adjustment: TRX length adjustment
- Position: Position relative to the anchor point
- Start: Starting posture/body alignment
- Movement: Movement cue from start position to midpoint
- Return: Return cue from midpoint to end/start position

### Systematic Movement-Based Coaching: **FLAC**
- Focus
- Learn
- Apply
- Challenge

### Body Checks: Positive questions
- An affirmation
- A point of prevention
- A correction

### Coaching Phrases
1. **Engage your core or glutes**
- Engage, Activate, Contract, Squeeze, or Tighten your core/abs and glutes
- Draw in your belly button in
- Keep your core tight
- Lock in your core and glutes
- Brace your core

## Class Theme
